# aks_tutorial
The starting point to the code in this branch is the Microsoft document to create a simple ASP dotnet core web api that I found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code). 

To run the code:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Switch to this branch: `git checkout start_here`
3. Start the app: `dotnet run`
4. On your browser, go to localhost: `https://localhost:<<portnumber>>/WeatherForecast`
The port number is printed on your console in step 3.

You now have a running dotnet core web-api that we will try to run on aks next.
